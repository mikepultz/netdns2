= Local Cache =

Net_DNS2 includes a built-in local cache to improve query performance. The cache is disabled by default, and can use shared memory, using the PHP [http://ca2.php.net/manual/en/book.shmop.php Shmop Extension], or a flat file.

The local cache is only used for lookup queries, and is disabled for Updates.

== Shared Memory ==

Net_DNS2 uses the [http://ca2.php.net/manual/en/book.shmop.php Shmop Extension]. If you do not have the extension installed, and you specify to use the shared memory cache, Net_DNS2 will throw an exception.

=== Example ===

{{{

$r = new Net_DNS2_Resolver(array(

	'cache_type'	=> 'shared',
	'cache_file'	=> '/tmp/net_dns2.cache',
	'cache_size'	=> 100000
));

}}}

== Flat File ==

Net_DNS2 can use a flat file to store the cache information. The *cache_file* must be in a location PHP can write to, and has enough space to hold a file *cache_size* bytes big.

=== Example ===

{{{

$r = new Net_DNS2_Resolver(array(

	'cache_type'	=> 'file',
	'cache_file'	=> '/tmp/net_dns2.cache',
	'cache_size'	=> 100000
));

}}}

== Serialization Method ==

You can also adjust the serialization method used when storing the cache data. By default, Net_DNS2 uses the PHP serialize()/unserialize(), but you can also use JSON encoding.

JSON encoding is much faster then the PHP serialize functions, but it loses the class information of the objects- everything comes back as stdClass objects.

To change the serialization method, set "cache_serializer" to either "serialize" or "json".

=== Example ===

{{{

$r = new Net_DNS2_Resolver(array(

	'cache_type'	    => 'file',
	'cache_file'	    => '/tmp/net_dns2.cache',
	'cache_size'	    => 100000,
        'cache_serializer'  => 'json'
));

}}}

The speed difference is significant.
