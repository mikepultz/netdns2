= Local Cache =

Net_DNS2 includes a built-in local cache to improve query performance. The cache is disabled by default, and can use shared memory, using the PHP [http://ca2.php.net/manual/en/book.shmop.php Shmop Extension], or a flat file.

The local cache is only used for lookup queries, and is disabled for Updates.

== Shared Memory ==

Net_DNS2 uses the [http://ca2.php.net/manual/en/book.shmop.php Shmop Extension]. If you do not have the extension installed, and you specify to use the shared memory cache, Net_DNS2 will throw an exception.

=== Example ===

{{{

$r = new Net_DNS2_Resolver(array(

	'cache_type'	=> 'shared',
	'cache_file'	=> '/tmp/net_dns2.cache',
	'cache_size'	=> 100000
));

}}}

== Flat File ==

Net_DNS2 can use a flat file to store the cache information. The *cache_file* must be in a location PHP can write to, and has enough space to hold a file *cache_size* bytes big.

=== Example ===

{{{

$r = new Net_DNS2_Resolver(array(

	'cache_type'	=> 'file',
	'cache_file'	=> '/tmp/net_dns2.cache',
	'cache_size'	=> 100000
));

}}}
