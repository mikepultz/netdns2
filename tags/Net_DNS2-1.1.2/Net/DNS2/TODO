Net_DNS2 TODO List
------------------

- move the IP (v4 and v6) matching to functions- 
    - just use inet_ntop/pton()

- handle IPv6 in PTR records

- add more detailed documentation with lots of examples.

DONE - support some simple caching
    DONE - cache on disk or in shared memory so it can be used between multiple requests
    DONE - enable/disable by config option
    DONE - cache by request, and use TTL on response to invalidate the cache
    DONE - use a simple format like md5(serialized request object) => serialized response object.

DONE - go through all the code and figure out what the lowest possible PHP version we can
  support is
    - check for usage of any functions that aren't supported between OS's or are deprecated

     *** we need at least 5.1.2 for spl_autoload_register()

DONE - add support for the ATMA RR - supported by windows DNS servers only

DONE - change it so by default it uses the /etc/resolv.conf file if not options are specified

DONE - add auth support for SIG(0) (on top of TSIG); needs openssl

DONE - move auth support to the Net_DNS2 class so it can be used for both updates and queries
  (so it could be used for zone transfers)

DONE- update requests
	DONE - need TSIG RR


DONE - parse BIND style input and set all the appropriate values of the RR object

DONE - parse and read a resolv.conf file

DONE - fix up all teh exception handling

DONE - add proper function comments at the head of each method

DONE - change the defines() to class constants

DONE - add proper licensing at the top of each file
	DONE - change to BSD licensing

DONE - test classes

DONE - inverse_query

This query asks for a question whose answer is the Internet style
address 10.1.0.52.  Since the owner name is not known, any domain name
can be used as a placeholder (and is ignored).  A single octet of zero,
signifying the root, is usually used because it minimizes the length of
the message.  The TTL of the RR is not significant.  The response to
this query might be:
